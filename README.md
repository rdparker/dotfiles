Home Directory Configuration Files
==================================

To install this on a new machine:

	git clone https://github.com/rdparker/dotfiles ~/.home
	cd ~/.home
	./setup.csh

The setup script will configure the cloned repository to checkout
files into the home directory and will configure the home directory to
use the checked out repository.  Then it will safely checkout the
files without overwriting any preexisting ones and will report all
files that differ.
